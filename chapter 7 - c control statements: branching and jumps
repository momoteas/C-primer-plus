The if statement: 
        1) adding else to the if statement: 
        2) another example: introducing getchar() and putchar()
                1> these functions deal only with characters, they are faster and more compact than the more general
                scanf() and printf() functions. Also, note that they don't need format specifiers; that's because 
                they work with characters only. Both functions are typically defined in the stdio.h file;
        3) The ccttyyppee..hh Family of Character Functions: 
        4) multiple choice: else if;
        5) paring else with if: The rule is that an else goes with the most recent if unless braces indicate otherwise;
        6) summary: using is statements for making choices:
                1> keywords: if, else;
                2> general comments: In each of the following forms, the statement can be either a simple statement 
                   or a compound statement. A true expression means one with a nonzero value;
                3> form 1:
                        if ( expression )
                             statement
                4> form 2:
                        if ( expression )
                             statement1
                        else
                             statement2
                5> form 3:
                        if ( expression1 )
                             statement1
                        else if ( expression2 )
                             statement2
                        else
                             statement3

Let's get logical: 
        1) C has three logical operators: &&, ||, !;
        2) alternate spellings: the iso646.h header file; If you use this header file, you can use and instead 
           of && , or instead of ||, and not instead of !;
        3) Order of Evaluation: Logical expressions are evaluated from left to right;
