1 Initializing a Structure:
        . struct book library = {
              "The Pirate and the Devious Damsel",
              "Renee Vivotte",
              1.95
          };
          you use a comma-separated list of initializers enclosed in braces;
          
2 Gaining Access to Structure Members:        
        . The dot has higher precedence than the & here, so the expression is the same as &(library.float);
        
3 Designated Initializers for Structures:
        . struct book surprise = { .value = 10.99};
